         <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
         <p>Instagram</p>

         <p>Hick's law is states that the more option available, has a exponential increase in the amount of time it takes to 
            choose an option. I feel instagram is a great choice since the options are relatively limited on the homepage, and 
            categorizes and serches into generalizations so it it is easier to choose.</p>

         <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
         <p>Softonic</p>

         <p>While the desktop page isn't as great, it is clearly shown in the image that the button has a vibrant
             button that is centered on the page and extends to both sides. Considering that Fitt' law is about the
            decrease in users clicking a button based on its size and location, this would definately not detract from clicks. </p>

         <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
         <p>Apple</p>

         <p>Apple is the paragon of white space and clean design in my opinion. Their pages aren't cluttered 
            and the leave open area around each item to not draw away from the product.</p>
